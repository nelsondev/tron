# Nelson McCullough
I pride myself on the problems programmers face in their every day lives. It's When my mind takes over and I truely feel like I'm working towards something that actually matters to me. Something that truely feels natural to my thinking process, and challenges me on a daily basis. Programming is where my brain feels like it fully opens up to it's own creativity.

### Contents

Welcome to my personal git! Feel free to take a look around theres:
* minecraft game server modifications
* c++ console applications
* games
* pictures
* websites
* java applications
* and scratch files / early professional endeavors.

_Everything I've ever wanted to make really_.

### Applications / Development
Currently I'm working on multiple personal application projects. Most of them are early stages of planning, but some have working prototypes, design, etc. Most of them are at least slightly thought out.

#### What do I make my applications in?
Object oriented is my thing! Currently I know Java, C++, C, and JS along with Electron released by Github. All my Java and C++ endevours have been console application based projects, but I have experience with the electron API in making GUI based applications with JS, and Node.

I also have extensive knowledge in the Construct 2 web based game engine and have been making games with [website]http://git.dumbluckarts.com for 2 years doing what I love.

Currently my application, websites, games, etc houses are:
